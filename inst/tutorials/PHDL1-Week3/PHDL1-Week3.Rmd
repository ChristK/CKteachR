## Getting ready to use R

### Logistics

-   Learning R is like learning a foreign language. It may seem hard at first,
    but in time allows you to immerse into a new exciting culture.

-   If you feel that things don't make sense, don't worry. Everyone who uses R
    (or any other programming language) has been there, and we still do
    sometimes. Just ask your R-buddy or ask me!

-   During the PH data lab session, feel free to interrupt me at any time.

-   Some of the examples and exercises in this tutorial are inspired by a
    tutorial by [Graeme L. Hickey](https://www.glhickey.com/)

### What is R?

Derives from a proprietary software package called 'S-Plus'

-   "R is a free software programming language and software environment for
    statistical computing and graphics" Wikipedia (2014)

-   The "lingua franca of data analysts" The New York Times (2009)

-   Used worldwide by epidemiologists, bioinformaticians, data scientists,
    high-level statisticians, app developers, . . .

### Why use R?

-   Keep whole analysis together (data processing, analysis, publication
    figures, reports)

-   Reproducible research

-   State of the art statistical methods are wrapped up in 'R packages'

-   It is free and open-source

-   It is used by many companies & institutions [including the UK
    Government](https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/2017/03/27/reproducible-analytical-pipeline/)

### Objectives

The primary objective is for you to be able to apply statistical functions
available in R to your own data.

To achieve this you should be able to:

-   Understand the core concepts of R and its syntax

-   Be able to read and write data files

-   Be able to interrogate a dataset

-   Be able to use functions and options
    <!-- - Be able to write a simple function -->

### How to install R?

By now you you should all have received installation instructions. You can also
download them from the links below.

-   [For
    Windows](https://u.pcloud.link/publink/show?code=XZSpMFXZLRt8rDdjvhJK5gofRP9AkymsrJik)
-   [For
    Mac](https://u.pcloud.link/publink/show?code=XZIpMFXZzrAQ2MDDye7hpT740VSto8tpbBsy)
-   [For
    Linux](https://u.pcloud.link/publink/show?code=XZipMFXZXz0MIzctx040fvaWIsT8tyVCdLT7)

### R console

R looks like this. You type commands, you press enter, and R executes the
commands.

### RStudio

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. That means that
RStudio makes the experience working with R more comfortable and speeds-up the
development time of R projects. So, one could use R without RStudio (or any
other IDE) and achieve the same results. Still, most likely, the work would be
more time-consuming and less enjoyable.

We will deep into Rstudio in the coming weeks.

### Why use R?

```{r why-r, echo=FALSE}
question("Why use R? (Select ALL that apply)",
  answer("Allows reproducible research", correct = TRUE),
  answer("Free & open-source", correct = TRUE),
  answer("State of the art statistical methods", correct = TRUE),
  answer("To complicate our lifes", message = "It may feel that is too complicated in the beginning, but eventually the experience becomes smoother."),
  incorrect = "Incorrect. We use R because it offers state of the art statistical methods, it is free, and allows reproducible research.",
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  random_answer_order = TRUE
)
```


## R as a Calculator

### Simple maths

<!-- ```{r calculator-addition, eval= TRUE} -->
<!-- 1 + 1 -->
<!-- 13 * 17 -->
<!-- ((6 * 7) + 4 - 7) / 2^8 -->
<!-- ``` -->

### Other 'numbers' to look out for

Now, try to calculate 1/0, 0/0 and find out why it happened!

```{r caculator-other, eval= TRUE}
1/0
-1/0
0/0
```

<!-- If you see these, you have probably done something wrong! -->
